Activity

onCreate(): Initializes activity, sets layout, and creates UI components. Called once.
onStart(): Activity becomes visible but not interactive yet. Prepares for user interaction. Can be called multiple times.
onResume(): Activity is in the foreground and fully interactive. Resumes paused tasks. Can be called multiple times.
onPause(): Partially obscured by another activity or dialog. Save data and stop resource-consuming tasks. Guaranteed to be called before onStop().
onStop(): Activity no longer visible. Release resources and save data. Can be called multiple times.
onDestroy(): Final cleanup before activity destroyed. Free up memory and resources. Called once.


Fragments 

Enhance reusability and adaptability for different screen sizes. They exist within activities and have their own lifecycle,
which is closely tied to the host activity’s lifecycle.

The Fragment lifecycle consists of various states and corresponding callback methods:

1. onAttach(): Fragment gets associated with an activity.
2. onCreate(): Initialize non-UI components, such as data sources or network connections.
3. onCreateView(): Inflate the fragment’s layout and set up UI elements.
4. onActivityCreated(): Activity’s onCreate() completed; can access its views.
5. onStart(): Fragment becomes visible; prepare for user interaction.
6. onResume(): Fragment gains focus and starts receiving user input.
7. onPause(): Fragment loses focus; save changes and release resources.
8. onStop(): Fragment no longer visible; further cleanup.
9. onDestroyView(): Remove view hierarchy and release UI-related resources.
10. onDestroy(): Clean up remaining resources and detach from the activity.
11. onDetach(): Fragment fully detached from the activity.
